[Overview]:
1. Add "sign-in function"
2. Add "social media sharing" function to "copy to clipboard"
3. Merge "automatically choose short path" and "same path for existing URLs"


	• What features will you complete?
	
		a. Automatically choose short path, Use the same short 
path for existing URLs
		b. Enable users to copy the shorten URL in clipboard, 
sharing it on other social networks
		c. Mobile version of the web service
		d. Sign-in function to record user's history
		
	• Roughly how they will work
	
		a. The server will automatically assign the short path if 
users don't specify any custom alias. Meanwhile, maintain a universal 
database in our server to verify if the URL 
		b. Users could simply click the "copy to clipboard" button 
and "open in the new window" button. No need to copy-paste. Plus, we will 
enable user to share via social networks like Facebook
		c. Make the web service working in mobile and tablets 
using media query.
		d. User could register and sign-in. We maintain the record 
of the usernames and passwords. After sign in, user could view his/her 
shortening history displayed chronologically in the same page.

	• What you anticipate main challenge to be
	
		a. Some function like "copy to clipboard" might not work 
in mobile version
		b. How to random the alias automatically
